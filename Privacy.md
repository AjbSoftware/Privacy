IN MORE DETAIL

YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT

We will never collect and use personal information without consent. That is why users can download our applications without personal information being shared with us. Third parties involved in the download of our applications (like an appstore) might sometimes collect this data and will inform users themselves about the use of any personal information involved. We also do not keep track of usage of our applications on an individual level. Statistical data about usage might be available to us, but this will always be made anonymous and only used to improve the quality of our products and services.

MINIMUM INFORMATION NEEDED

To provide you with full functionality, our applications might need access to certain other features on your device. The application will ask permission to access these features when you install the application. You can always change these settings in the application management of your device. But doing so might interfere with the performance of the application. Furthermore, any information you enter in one of our applications for personal use, will not be taken out of the app by us without your consent. Our Easy Ebook Converter app converts your files online to give you the best experience. Therefore the file you want to convert will be securely uploaded to our server for conversion. This information will be stored for the time needed for the conversion. After you have downloaded the converted file, the information will be automatically deleted. The content of the file you want to convert will never be accessed by us.

WHEN YOU SHARE INFORMATION 

Some of our (non-paid) applications contain advertisements to support development. These are provided by a third party; AdMob. AdMob might use the advertising ID provided by your device to personalize the advertisements you see when you use the application. This will help them show advertisements that match your interests. More information on possible personal information collected by AdMob can be found here. If you do not want to share this personal information you can choose to only view non-personalized apps. It might also be that you provide personal information to us when you contact us for example to submit a support question or help us improve our products and services. This information will only be used for that purpose, will be handled with care and stored safely on our servers. By providing us with this information, you expressly consent to our use of this information in accordance with this privacy policy.

WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
